## Description

This Python script sorts your ModConfigs.xml (RimWorld mod configuration) for better loading time 
putting the dependencies of your mod order in the right spot. This is also the only function of the 
script, it will do this one thing and nothing else. 

Managing mods ((un)subscribing, mod load lists etc) is beyond the scope of this script, there 
is a better ingame solution called "Mod Manager" by Fluffy. The only thing it does, is optimizing
the mod load order.

For using the script you need an active internet connection which will connect to Github, where
the current sort order database resides.

## Command Line Options
Option | Description
--- | ---
--help | displays helps and valid command line arguments
--disable-steam | force disable Steam checks
--disable-tweaks | disable user tweaks
--enable-delays | enables some delays for better reading of the output
--dont-remove-unknown-mods | do not remove unknown mods
--openbrowser | opens a web browser if an update is available
--dump-configuration | dumps the current configuration and exits
--dump-configuration-nowait | dumps the current configuration and explicitly do not wait (for scripting)
--contributors | list all contributors to the script and the database who have contributed more than 10 mods
--reset-to-core | reset ModsConfig.xml to just Core
--steamdir directory | set steam installation directory (disables "disablesteam" too)
--drmfreedir directory | set DRM free directory of RimWorld
--configdir directory | set savegame /config directory of RimWorld
--workshopdir directory | set Steam Workshop directory
--localmodsdir directory | set local mods directory
--dry-run | Print the changes which are going to take place before actually doing them

Note that the switches which are named identical to the configuration options override these, so the
priority order of options is: **default settings - configuration file - command line arguments.**

The directory options check if the directory exists and if they do not, RWMS will stop.

Priority of configurion source is as follows in descending priority, a higher priority overrides the
lower ones:
- command line
- configuration file
- RWMS script defaults

## Usage

Just run the script with 
> python rwms_sort.py
 
or

> python36 rwms_sort.py

or (Windows)

> rwms_sort.bat

or (Linux)

> rwms_sort.sh

There should be no interactions if not desired (except writing ModsConfig.xml if 
you have unknown mods).

If some mods are unknown, the script will generate a *rwms_unknown_mods_YYYYmmdd-HHMM.json.txt* file,
where all unknown mods are listed. Please submit this file in the forum thread or in the sister
project, RWMSDB on https://github.com/shakeyourbunny/RWMSDB/issues  

## Upgrading
It is recommended that you do a clean installation, but you can copy over your 
rwms_config.ini in the new directory, but do not forget to check this documentation for
new (or changed) settings.

## Installation
### Python 3.6+

You need a Python 3.6+ installation on your computer. This script does not work with Python 2 or
Python 3 distributions less then 3.6. That means that you will have to have AT LEAST Python 3.6 in
your system, higher revisions are fine.

#### Windows
Windows binary downloads are available for download on the Github release page.

If you wish to use the source directly, see below.

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on the big yellow "Download Python 3.7.x"
button, let the installer run and let Python be added to the search path.

After that you can start directly python (.py) files from the explorer, but I recommend using the 
batch file rwms_sort.bat. Default behaviour of RWMS is now that it will wait after a fatal error
and after it is finished. This may be changed through the configuration file, though.

#### Linux distributions
Many distributions still have Python 2 as system default and RWMS is a pure Python 3 script; I did
not test it with Python 2 and it uses some more recent features of 3, so you have to check, if 
your default python version with
> python --version

Mostly, this will be 2.7, so you have to install Python 3 too. 

Linux Distribution     | Source | How to install
--- | --- | ---
Debian / Ubuntu / Mint | PPA            | https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get#865569
Fedora (recent) | repo | sudo dnf install python37
CentOS 7 | repo | sudo yum install centos-release-scl && sudo yum install rh-python36
Arch Linux / Manjaro | repo | pacman -S python (should already be installed)

#### OSX
Download and install Python via https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ (latest release).

#### Missing modules
After this, run install_requirements.sh (Linux / OSX) or install_requirements.cmd
to install missing Python modules.

### RWMS installation
Download the source distribution from the releases page and unzip it in a 
folder of your liking. Alternatively, you can also clone the repository.

## Configuration file
The configuration file *rwms_config.ini* is only needed if the autodetection fails (or on other 
platforms than Windows / Steam). Just open the configuration in your favorite text editor (NOT
Microsoft Word) and you can modify all paths there. 

You can see what RWMS is thinking about your configuration with the command

`rwms_sort.sh --dump-configuration`

### General options
There are no default values, you have to fill them in for yourself.

**Note: If you are using Steam (regardless of operating system) and you have RimWorld installed
in the default library, you mostly don't need configure the directories.**

entry | description
--- | ---
steamdir | path to your steam installation (not the game itself).
drmfreedir | path to your DRM-free RimWorld game installation, not used for a steam installation (and vice versa).
configdir | path to the main RimWorld configuration directory in your user profile.
workshopdir | path to your RimWorld steam workshop directory (ends with the steam appid). 
localmodsdir | path to your locally installed RimWorld mods in the RimWorld game directory (ends with Mods).

You may have to use quotes, if the path has spaces in it and always provide the full path. 

Additional parameters control if you want to enable the update check, waiting for keypresses and
optional automatic submitting unknown mods to the database issue tracker.

NB: you always can check your (detected) folder configuration with
> python rwms_configuration.py

in your shell (Windows Command Line, Linux shell)

### Update Check
entry | default value | description
--- | --- | ---
updatecheck | True | tells RWMS either to check for new updates or not. This is just a version check, no autoupdate.
openbrowser_on_update | False | opens a new (default) web browser window with the RWMS page, if a newer version is available.

### Interactive and misc options
These are the default options on waiting for keypresses etc.

entry | default value | description
--- | --- | ---
waitforkeypress_on_error | True | wait for a keypress / Enter after an error occurs.
waitforkeypress_on_exit | True | wait for a keypress / Enter to exit the program.
enabledelaysinoutput | True | enable some delays in output of script, for better reading.

entry | default value | description
--- | --- | ---
disablesteam | False | ignore any steam installations or related stuff
dontremoveunknown | False | do not remove unknown mods from the ModsConfig.xml (and stick them at the bottom)

### GitHub submission options
If you want your unknown mods automatically submitted as an issue, please configure these 
settings. They are fully optional.

entry | default value | description
--- | --- | ---
github_username | - | user name on GitHub
github_password | - | your GitHub password

## Notes on the unknown mods file
If RWMS finds any unknown mods, they will be recorded on a rwms_unknown_mods_YYYYMMDD-HHMM.json.txt
file in the current working directory. This file may be submitted to the RWMSDB Github tracker or
will be automatically, if GitHub user credentials (see above) are provided. 

This data file includes the names of all unknown mods, timestamp of generation of the file and
(beginning with 0.94.1) some meta information about the installation: operating system, RimWorld
build number, type of operating system environment (Windows/Linux/OSX) and a version number. The 
latter describes the version of the data structure format and is used for merge tool for  the 
database in order to parse the file correctly.
